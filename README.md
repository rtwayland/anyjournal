# AnyJournal
This is a journaling app geared toward engineers wanting to keep a developer journal. Why not write your journal using Vim or Emacs? Why not have your journal support programming languages you use and might want to record? AnyJournal does that. And if you aren't an engineer but just want a simple journaling app, we've got you covered!
